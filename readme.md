# Intention Timer


## Project Description
This application allows a user to set goals for their health and productivity, tied to an amount of time. Users will select an activity category, set the amount of time they want to spend on that activity, and start the timer. The app will log that activity to keep track of how the user has been spending their time. See project rubric [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/intention-timer-group.html).

## Functionality
+ A user begins by selecting a category (Study, Meditate, Exercise), writing a description of the activity, and entering the time they wish to spend on it.
+ The form is unable to be submitted until all fields are appropriately filled out.
+ When the user clicks "Start Activity", the timer view will become visible.
+ When the user clicks "Start", the timer will countdown from the time they provided in the form.
+ When the time is up, the start button will indicate completion and an option to click "Log Activity" appears.
+ When the activity is logged, a card is generated in the right column under "Past Activities" and saves the activity to local storage.
+ Another button then appears for the user to switch back to form view and create a new activity.
+ The user is able to clear past activities by clicking the corresponding button.
